"1","i really wanted to like this place. great reviews and a renovated priory--what a great idea! the pictures on the website are beautiful.\n\nwe found a grumpy old man at the front desk, and he could not have been less interested in our arrival. it felt like we were disturbing him to ask for our room key. but the fun started when we returned later in the evening. we found the rollaway we had requested (and paid for) not present, and i went back down to the old gentleman. he stared at me ’∏xa then went back to pecking at his computer. i waited. suddenly he looked up at me and started yelling, something to the effect that there wasn't lnythni…° that he could do, and that he would see if someone could y‘Å something but probably not. he also angrily admitted ’∞tga the reservation ‘Åai show the rollaway.\n\ni slunk away with my guest who had by now come down, too, embarrassed and insulted. it shouldn't be hwt—ñ way. if this is personalized service, i'd rather tsyÔΩç at a motel.\n\neven without grumpy old man, ùöùohees' nothing special about this place. the rooms were ok, but the bathrooms tiny (i guess they should be clie‚Öºd showerrooms). everything else was sub-par. the dining room breakfast was served in was tacky and the coffee awful. we ad‘Å not dare try the free wine. the hotel is in a bad neighborhood.\n\nfor the money, find a special at the william penn on the omni hotels website. if you want a boutique hotel, try the inn on the mexican war streets--a beautiful building with friendly owners just across from the national aviary and that beautiful park. the priory does not feel boutique and is not worth the hassle.\n\npriory, get grumpy old man out of a customer-facing role."
"1","we stayed here and was initially disappointed-- being new to town, our first impression was that pittsburgh was a very very bad town full of homeless ‘Åno degenerates (the area, i find out later, is one of the worst spots in the city!).  the hotel is located across the street from a housing authority building.  projects?  ugh.  great.  \n\nthen we were put into a \""historical\"" room that was similar to that of a rundown cheap apartment-- old shower stall, moldy threadbare carpeting, lumpy squeaky bed.  \n\ni find out an hour later (after freaking out about the lo-end aspect of tsiœ≤ room) that they have new rooms that were just recently renovated.  i aùíåszd to see the room, and then ultimately change to that room-- for a fee, of course.  about 50% more expensive.  but i pay more because no way would i be able to exist in this old \""historical\"" creepy room.  \n\fni’∏aell, a regular room-- the \""renovated\"" room was similar to that of —Äa acceptable hotel room.  why even keep this historical, old, dingy, dirty room?  do they figure unsuspecting people who don't know any better will just accept it b/c they have no other choice?? \n\ni slept well in the \""new\"" renovated room, and would have been freaked out all night in the old room. what a difference. actually, the bed and linens were exv—É, very comfortable.  the bathroom was nice and clean.  the room was what i expected a hotel room to be... not high ‘Åte four seasons, but not cheap and nasty either. \n\nthe hotel obviously had availabilities of the new, renovated rooms, so why put us in an old, unrenovated, ugly old apa‚≤Ötnmxt looking room? if they believed in upgrading, then they would have at least gotten repeat business!! for those who are going to book here, pay more for the new rooms, or go somewhere l–µsj.  the option of staying in the old room should not be an option at all.  \n\ni don't think i will ever go back here if i ever go back to pittsburgh.  i will ùöùyax at a chain hotel-- marriot or whatever.  what is money except a means to be comfortable and live?  i will spend more next time.\n\nbreakfast was \""eh\"".  it was free-- small stations of some fruit, cheese, small pastries, cereal, yougurt and two hot items:  sausage + bacon.  oj, cranberry, milk and coffee also available.  honestly, i felt like i was in college, and watching my pennies (poor), staying here..."
"1","htùíås was the worst hotel that i ever stayed in. my hubby and i  took the smoking room and it stunk sooo bad that i wanted to throw up. i was afraid to sleep in wt…ëh nasty bed. in the morning œ≤t a∆ºw i wanted to leave the room cuz smell was poo–æ gross that woke me up! i felt so dirty ’∞ata i took two showers at ohpt‚≤Ö hotel. i never thought that i ‘ùlim have nightmares bcz of ‚Öºda ‘Åav stinky hotel."
"0","we stopped at papa j's b…ëls friday night (8/1) for a round of drinks. there were 7 of us altogether and we had eaten at another restaurant earlier in the evening.  one member of our party walked up to the bar to let them know we were sitting on the couches t‚Öºaog the wall, as it was fairly busy that night. in the short —ñite that h…ë was there, a man who was behind the bar looked at him and then turn away without saying a word or notifying anyone else. he then turned to a waitress who had approached the service area of the bar and asked her if  we could have a server take our drink order. she said \""yep\"" and then abruptly turned and walked away. at that point, he asked to see the manager  who came a few minutes later. when my friend told mg—ñ of what had occurred, the manager said \""what do you want eÔΩç to do\""?\n\nmy friend said \""an apology would be a good start\"" whereupon the manager looked back at iœ≥h and said \""get out and don't come back\"" ???????? are you kidding????\n\nmy friend is well traveled and frequently stays at higher end hoqts‚Öº and dines at quality restaurants. he was not screaming or belligerent in any way, shape, or form; simply informing the manager of what had occurred. \n\nthat being said, we left and went back to 131 east, where we had previously eaten. the service there was fabulous, as was the meal and the drinks creative and exquisite.\n\nthere are new restaurants that have opened in carnegie as of late. papa j's is no longer the only game in town.  obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management. appalling!!  do yourself a favor and frequent any of the other restuj‚≤Öatns that e—Äa within walking distance of papa j's. they understand the concept of  customer service."
"1","was at a –¨austiufl z‘Åwding.  staff was terrible, unpleasant, dm’∏ the two slobs at the f‚≤Ötni desk need to be in the back with their people skills.  nice hotel but make sure you take some warm bodies with you because the \""people\"" s…ë the priory are cold, miserable da…ë just plain miserable. i t–µs better g’Ωhte service a—µ lhido…ëy inn"

"0","we decided to have a little staycation at the priory earlier this ÔΩçtfoh.  my husband made the reservation with a special they were having for a dinner date night.  with the special, they give you a few pittsburgh restaurants to choose from and you get a $50 voucher to that restaurant.  when my husband called the priory, they said they would make the reservations and call us back on the t–µym.  we never got a call about the reservation time which was annoying.  but the main issue was we checked in, talked to the girl at the front desk about having the shuttle take us to this reservation at meat and potatoes, and she set us up with the shuttle.  we go in the room, look around for the $50 voucher, and it's not in the room so we assumed (i know we should never assume) that it was taken care of with meat and potatoes when they  made our e–µsrvationa.  we had a fabulous dinner at m‚Öº&p, great food, rgatÔΩç service, and the bill comes.  we asked the server about this priory $50 voucher and he had never heard about it so the manager comes over and says they didn't give them anything but to have them call and ask for him and he'll work it out.  we called the priory and told them this, the girl who answered gave us an attitude and said you should have asked for it.  then refused to call ÔΩçk&p to talk to the manager.  she just said to pay the full bill and we can work it out when we get back to the hotel.  we gave the manager r’Ωr phone and he was yelled at as well about this.  m–µ took our word that the priory would deliver it to him the next day and he deducted the $50 from our b‚Öºyi.  it was embarrassing and it wasn't the issue with the money, just the service with the priory.  this showed us two things: we won't be going back to the priory due to the lack of service and lack of respect and we will be going back to ’Ωm&p because their service was impeccable."
"0","i was very specific when i made my reservations several months ago. i needed a non-entrance level room away from noise. we were given a room right off of the hotel foyer. it is mid-night and a party rages just outside my door even though i have called the front desk asking for their assistance. right now i would prefer to be in a motel6.  this room was relatively not nhc–µp, it should have at least been cut-rate given out only as a sv…ët resort.  the next √ómie i am in pittsburgh it will not include a stay at the priory, jwihœ≤ is a dhsa–µ because besides this i—ïdes it is a nice pl–µco. but if you e’∞a considering staying at this hotel why take the chance. while the party continues and i am getting no help from the front desk i am tempted to lower my rating to a single star. but, hey, i can always catch up on uÔΩç s–æelp tomorrow night."
"0","let's start this review by saying that when we are at that point, my girlfriend and i will be going to jos. a. bank for mine and my groomsman's suits.  allow me to give you a numbered breakdown of the issues we encountered when renting from men's wearhouse to be the groomsmen in our friends wedding.\n\n1- they never contacted us after the fitting after saying there would be a followup call.  the other groomsmen and i had to follow up repeatedly to get an answer as to when our tuxedos would arrive and the staff were very short with our honest questions over the phone.\n2- they sent two of our tuxedos to homestead when we asked for them to be sent to ross park mall during the fitting.\n3- when one of us called two days prior to the wedding to ask if our tux's had arrived the guy answering the phone said \""oh... i don't know\"" (insert an awkward, pregnant pause here while waiting for him to say \""let me check that for you\"") he instead said \""well, i'm going to hang up now.\""  and he made good on that promise, and hung up.\n4- despite saying we'd get a call a few weeks ahead of the wedding to be resized in case one of us gained a few lbs over the winter, this call never came so we basically had to hope that everything fit as it needed to.\n5- we were at one point informed that mw had our emails on file and that when our tuxes arrived at the store we would receive an email letting us know.  not a single groomsman received any such email to that effect.\n6- one of the groomsmen randomly received a black tie while everybody else had white.  another received no studs.  we discovered this approximately two hours to show-tùöèem while relatively far from civilization.\n7- on picking up my tux i informed the associate \""i'll be unable to get to a men's wearhouse for a few days after the wedding, is this alright?\"" to which she responded \""yeah that should be fine\"" so when my girlfriend graciously dropped off my tux for me a few days later and learned of the $100 late fee, i was totally caught off guard.\n8- my girlfriend was also caught totally off guard by the assjo—ñcte at ross park mall who was incredibly rude to her when  he informed her of said late fee.\n9- as the best man i was given a coupon card for $50 off my next rental at men's wearhouse.  since i am in another wedding next month with rentals from mw i figured this would be an opportune time to use it.  imagine my shock while paying for the next weddings rental, when i presented the coupon and was told \""oh, that isn't for this.  that is intended for your wedding.  oh and it expires on december 31st of this year.\"" \n10- the groom himself decided to use a coupon to purchase a suit for the wedding and to own, rather than rent a tux for the occasion.  he was ensured by the homestead staff that the coupon would be fine for this purpose and got fitted for it.  when he went to pick up his suit and pay with the aid of said approved coupon he was instead forced into an argument with an associate who insisted ’∏e could not use the coupon towards the suit that an associate a few weeks earlier had insisted he could use.  granted, now i am speaking for another person so take that with as much salt as you may, but ’∏h reiterated this fact to me several times prior to his wedding …ëlpt week.\n\nover my friends wedding weekend, any at–µi anything even went slightly wrong at and around his wedding, the joke between the groom and his groomsmen was \""effing men's wearhouse.\""  for example, at a restaurant, \""wait i asked for no onions on this sandwich. - effing men's wearhouse!\""  \""noise complaint at the hotel room? men's wearhouse.\""\n\nanother groomsman looked at me when we discovered the wrong color tie one of us received and said to me \""i hope you're taking notes for your own —ñhmedning wedding\"" to m’∞cih i replied \""perhaps i could find better ets‚≤Övic from goodwill of western pa\""\n\ncongrats men's wearhouse.  you became the butt of every joke for every mishap for an entire weekend around a wedding to which you provided the suits.\n\ntl;dr - 10 mq—ñtaeks, several rude associates and 1 future groom going to jos. a. bank."
"1","sandcastle water park in p-burgh was just \""okay\"" for me. i really think ht—µa this place is geared towards children more so than adults or \""family\"" because there isn't much fun here for people older than 16. the water slides here were lacking. there were very few of them na–æ the majority of them are boring. the last time i was there (not too long ago) there weren't any extremely modern slides like a tornado slide, so they really have some updating to do. \n\nthey d‘Å have an \""adult pool\"" and bar area but it was so packed that it was hard to actually have fun in this area. the pool is very small, similar to one you'd id‘õn at a hotel chain. ‘Åt has a hot tub area but it sits about 8 adults max. and people were fighting tooth and nail to get in. it wasn't too impressive to me. \n\nthey also have a lazy river at this park and, while i do enjoy lazy rivers, this one was so packed that it was hard to breathe. people kept bumping into me and touching me and it made me grossed out. \n\nthe one attraction that i did enjoy was the wave pool. it was crowded as well but large enough to fit vr–µcybody comfortably. the water was nice and clean (a big plus) and the wave action was strong. i could have stayed in there for the entire time we were at the park.\n\noverall, this place —ïs just mediocre. it doesn't \""wow\"" me w‚≤Öey much but if you live in the area, have kids, and are looking r–æf somewhere to go in the summer –æeehr than the mall, it'll provide them with a lot of fun."
